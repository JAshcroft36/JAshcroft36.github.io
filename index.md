## Hi, Iâ€™m James Ashcroft ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Wellcome Sanger Clinical PhD Fellow at the University of Cambridge,  
studying how regulatory programmes shape cell identity across the human ovary  
using single-cell, spatial, and multi-omic datasets.

Outside the lab, Iâ€™m a ceramic artist interested in Japanese and Chinese  
porcelain traditions â€” from celadon glazes to sometsuke brushwork.
