I am a genomics PhD student at the University of Cambridge and Wellcome Sanger Institute. My work focuses on spatial transcriptomics and single-cell multi-omic integration to understand how regulatory programs shape cell identity.

I have a strong interest in combining computational biology, genetics, and developmental cell biology to explore tissue microenvironments and cellular communication.

I work primarily in Python and R, comfortable scripting in Bash, mostly run large-scale analyses on HPC environments.
